            foresee that it'll be annoying to write the same set of utilities 50 different times per-project. So, lfc is my personal solution to that problem, point
            being to basically fill any niche I need that the C (and POSIX I guess) standard library doesn't adequately provide. Some days it's really cool, and
            others it feels like I'm writing the code equivalent of bitter medicine, where I just have to finish it because I know it's good for me.`

            it seems more fun to write the stuff I need myself, much the same as with lfc. Who knows whether or not it'll pan out or turn out as useful as it seems, but it's
            worth a shot.`

          to visually demonstrate how Python objects are organized in memory. Later, my two good friends & I were searching for project ideas at HackUCI 2020
          when we decided to create a website that could dynamically generate these "Pattis diagrams" for arbitrary Python code. We got a decent proof-of-concept
          going at the hackathon, for which we were fortunate enough to win Best Entrepreneurial Hack, and we then spent the next 6 months or so fully bringing
          the idea to life. We went through several full rewrites of the app, learned a ton about Python, Django, and software design, and eventually did end up with
          a functional website that did what we originally intended. To date I think it's the most complex piece of software I've built from scratch, so needless to say
          I had a great technical and personal experience building it with my team.`, // TODO: insert links to ryan/patrick sites
