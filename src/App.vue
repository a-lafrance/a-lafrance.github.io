             and systems security. Among other things, networking, computer architecture, and electrical/computer engineering are also cool.

          out the kinks in the system and writing tons of code (Swift for iOS and Rust for our backend stack). It's great to see our work

          "standard library" that I maintain on an as-need basis. Honestly, that's one of the fun parts about C: not only the ability, but the
          need to think about manually implementing this stuff that you can usually take for granted.`,

          about the internal memory representations of certain Python data structures. Inspired by this technique, my two good friends and I
          decided to create a tool that dynamically generates these diagrams at HackUCI 2020. We created Tapestry, a web-based code visualization
          tool capable of generating these memory diagrams for arbitrary Python programs. We even spent the next few months further developing
          the tool, and who knows, it might make its way into the "Current Work" section at some point.`,
