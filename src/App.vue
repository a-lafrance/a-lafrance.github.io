          It's an interesting technical challenge to design idiomatic Rust interfaces for AI/ML concepts while also trying not to get locked in a death match with the
          borrow checker. So far I've gotten some basic probability & adversarial search functionality done, with more to come in the future.`,

          to visually demonstrate how Python objects are organized in memory. Later, my two good friends & I were searching for project ideas at HackUCI 2020
          when we decided to create a website that could dynamically generate these "Pattis diagrams" for arbitrary Python code. We got a decent proof-of-concept
          going at the hackathon, for which we were fortunate enough to win Best Entrepreneurial Hack, and we then spent the next 6 months or so fully bringing
          the idea to life. We went through several full rewrites of the app, learned a ton about Python, Django, and software design, and eventually did end up with
          a functioning website that did what we originally intended. To date I think it's the most complex piece of software I've built from scratch, so needless to say
          I had a good time technically and personally building it with my team.`, // TODO: insert links to ryan/patrick sites

            relative to an existing LLVM IR-based alterntaive, where I found that my custom instrumentation is much more lightweight, producing binaries that
            are about 60% smaller, and which carry ~95% less instrumentation data. I've also spent some time working on tooling & infrastructure to support
            toolchain users by reporting and tracking profile health across builds, so they can effectively monitor the effectiveness of the instrumentation over time.`
