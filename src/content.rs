                        About 6 months ago, my roommates and I started Foodpool, a food delivery startup that's building affordable delivery through \"foodpooling\"
                        (think carpooling, but with food delivery). At this point we're iterating on our initial project to validate our business model & iron out the kinks with it. We
                        write Swift for our iOS app and our backend stack is done in Rust, so it's been really cool to work with both languages and platforms in a 0-to-100
                        production setting. In recent news, we launched in closed alpha (the \"initial product\" I mentioned); hopefully there are more exciting things to come!

                        Relative to most (all?) modern languages, C doesn't give you much out of the box. Most of what I'd consider part of a language's standard library aren't
                        really there, save for whatever systems utilities libc gives you. I tend to need that stuff in some form when I write C, so I decided to write all of it
                        once so that I can use it anywhere I need to by compiling it into this handy library of miscellaneous C utilities.

                        In ICS 33, the last UCI intro to CS class, Prof. Pattis used \"memory diagrams\" drawn with ASCII art to teach us
                        about the internal memory representations of Python objects. Inspired by this technique, my two good friends and I
                        decided to create a tool that dynamically generates these diagrams at HackUCI 2020. We created Tapestry, a web-based code visualization
                        tool capable of generating these memory diagrams for arbitrary Python programs. We even spent the next few months further developing
                        the tool, and who knows, it might make its way into the \"Current Work\" section at some point.
