                        Foodpool is a food delivery startup my roommates and I created to make food delivery affordable for everyone,
                        centered around the idea of \"foodpooling\": carpooling, but with food delivery. Over the last 6 months or so, we've been ironing
                        out the kinks in the system and writing tons of code (Swift for iOS and Rust for our backend stack). It's great to see our work
                        start to pay off too: we just launched in closed alpha in March 2022!

                        Let's face it: C doesn't give you much out of the box. If you need to use most of the conveniences provided by
                        modern languages, you have to write them yourself. To that end, lfc is where I write them myself: it almost feels like a running
                        \"standard library\" that I maintain on an as-need basis. Honestly, that's one of the fun parts about C: not only the ability, but the
                        need to think about manually implementing this stuff that you can usually take for granted.

                        In ICS 33, the last UCI intro to CS class, Prof. Pattis used \"memory diagrams\" drawn with ASCII art to teach us
                        about the internal memory representations of certain Python data structures. Inspired by this technique, my two good friends and I
                        decided to create a tool that dynamically generates these diagrams at HackUCI 2020. We created Tapestry, a web-based code visualization
                        tool capable of generating these memory diagrams for arbitrary Python programs. We even spent the next few months further developing
                        the tool, and who knows, it might make its way into the \"Current Work\" section at some point.
