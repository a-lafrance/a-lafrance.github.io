                Born & raised in Silicon Valley. Currently studying computer science at UC Irvine ('23) where I'm fortunate enough to
                work with Prof. Anton Burtsev. Also in between summers working on compilers @ Meta. I'm broadly interested in
                programming language design & implementation, operating systems, and security. I also enjoy messing around with Rust,
                both as a user and as a contributor to the ecosystem.

                        RedCC is the research project I'm currently working on, where I'm augmenting the Rust compiler to transparently uphold a special invariant about
                        RedLeaf's shared heap. This is just a fancy technical way to say that I'm hacking my own MIR pass into a custom fork of the Rust compiler that
                        will enforce a rule about ownership in RedLeaf's shared heap, without users of the compiler even knowing about it. Well, I guess that was still
                        pretty technical, but whatever. Anyway, what this means is that I've basically been diving deep into how the Rust compiler works to implement
                        the pass myself, after some brainstorming & design with the rest of the team. Having such autonomy to add a pretty big piece to a
                        really complex piece of software has been a great technical challenge so far.

                        In CS 142B the quarter-long goal is basically to write your own compiler from scratch, given a toy language called \"tiny\" and a general outline of how
                        the compiler should work. We're given more or less complete freedom for the actual implementation of the compiler (e.g. language, design of the actual
                        compiler software), which is a great challenge because it lets me think through tough architecture problems firsthand, implement the designs I come up with,
                        and even iterate on them when the requirements for those APIs change. It's turning out to be one of the most complex systems I've ever built,
                        so that's pretty cool. Oh, and of course I chose to do it in Rust.

                        In ICS 33, the last UCI intro to CS class, Prof. Pattis used \"memory diagrams\" drawn with ASCII art to teach us
                        about the internal memory representations of Python objects. Inspired by this technique, my two good friends and I
                        decided to create a tool that dynamically generates these diagrams at HackUCI 2020. We created Tapestry, a web-based code visualization
                        tool capable of generating these memory diagrams for arbitrary Python programs. We even spent the next few months further developing
                        the tool, and who knows, it might make its way into the \"Current Work\" section at some point.
