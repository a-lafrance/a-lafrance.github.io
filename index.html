          <h1 class="navy">Hi,</h1>
          <h3 class="navy">I'm Arthur Lafrance</h3>

          <p>Although I was born and raised in Silicon Valley, I currently study computer science
            at the UC Irvine Donald Bren School of ICS, as a member of the class of 2023. I'm very broadly interested in a wide
            range of subjects: artificial intelligence & machine learning, programming languages/operating systems/distributed systems,
            and software engineering.

            <br /><br />

            Whether through personal projects, professional experience, or academics, I'm always furthering these interests -- in my free time, I can almost
            always be found coding, reading, & learning. My personal favorite thing I'm learning right now is the Rust programming language; although the learning curve is steep,
            its compile-time memory & concurrency safety guarantees are fascinating.

            <p class="description">Beginning in winter 2021, I've begun research under the direction of Prof. Wayne Hayes. The
              core problem the group is currently solving is developing classification methods backed by statistical significance.
              My work is mostly concerned with the implementation of a novel nearest neighbor distance classifier, implementing components
              of the classifier such as nearest neighbor search, testing infrastructure such as results plotting, and optimizing the classifier to
              scale up well to large datasets.

                capable of basic shape creation and manipulation (both graphical and physical) using Swift, and integrated it with
                Centric's existing infrastructure using mainly Objective-C. I also became more comfortable working in a professional
                software engineering environment (particularly remotely), and thoroughly enjoyed my time working with the mobile team.

                maintaining a set of several popular UCI-related iOS apps (UCI students may be particularly interested to hear that
                one such app is ZotFinder, the unofficial official choice for on-campus navigation). As part of this, I work mainly
                with Swift, Python (using Chalice and AWS Lambda), and various database technologies (AWS DynamoDB & MySQL running on
                AWS EC2). Through working with the Student Center, I have honed my skills with backend & full-stack iOS development,
                and also learned to better coexist with a team of like-mindedly passionate developers.

              as a simple project management space, allowing the artist to keep track of the projects they've undertaken, and allowing
              clients to monitor the progress of their projects' completion.

            <p class="description">Recently, I've become interested in Rust for its compile-time memory safety, ergonomic syntax,
              and high performance. This has coincided with my (continuing) introduction to AI and machine learning, so I reasoned that
              a great way to combine the two would be to create Pensiv,
              a Rust library (crate) providing my own implementations of various AI & machine learning techniques. To date, I've implemented basic probability & statistics, and adversarial search is actively
              in development; I have no doubt that this project will continue to grow as I become more experienced and thus have more
              knowledge and abilities to share through the crate. In the near future, I'm hoping to expand to basic classification,
              regression, and clustering techniques, and I'll probably toy with the implementation of neural networks and graphical models
              in the future as well. Overall, I'm grateful to have the opportunity to further my passions for Rust & machine learning through
              continued development of Pensiv.

              <p class="description">BotNet is an ongoing collection of AI-related programs I decide to write in my spare time;
                it's mainly just a place for me to experiment with interesting applications/implementations of AI techniques I choose
                to pursue and a place for me to sharpen my C++ skills. My first contribution to it will be an adversarial search-based
                Mancala player, as well as a minimal implementation of the game. Oh, and don't mind the ominous name; I thought of the
                name "BotNet" because it was a collection ("network") of intelligent agents ("bots"), and decided to go with it because
                I thought the name conflict with the type of cyberattack was amusing (although the actual cyberattack is obviously much less
                amusing).

            <p class="description">At HackUCI 2020, two good friends and I created Tapestry, a web-based
              code visualization tool inspired by the "ASCII memory diagrams" used by one of our professors (which we were
              fortunate enough to be awarded Best Entrepreneurial Hack for). We aimed to create a tool that could generate these
              diagrams for arbitrary Python programs, in order to provide an interactive visual learning experience for computer
              science students. Since the hackathon, we have expanded our initial proof-of-concept to more fully realize this goal,
              creating a frontend website using TypeScript and Vue that provides a minimalist IDE and diagram display, and a
              backend API using Python, Django, and SQLite that remotely executes & generates diagrams for Python code snippets.

              <h4 class="title">Trivia Trek</h4>

              <p class="description">For the 2019 FBLA Mobile App Development competition, I worked with 2 other developers to create
                Trivia Trek, and iOS trivia board game to help users learn about FBLA trivia. We created the game using Swift,
                SpriteKit, and Firebase, where a user answers a series of questions in order to progress along one of two "maps"
                as fast as possible. Particularly, I worked on the app's frontend (gameplay) & backend (integration with Firebase),
                and was also in charge of maintaining the backend infrastructure (i.e. Firebase database). For our work on Trivia Trek, my team was
                fortunate enough to receive recognition at both the state & national levels of competition, placing 2nd at the CA
                FBLA State Leadership Conference and in the Top 15 at the FBLA National Leadership Conference.
