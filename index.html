          <h1 class="navy">Hi,</h1>
          <h3 class="navy">I'm Arthur Lafrance</h3>

          <p>Although I was born and raised in Silicon Valley, I currently study computer science 
            at the UC Irvine Donald Bren School of ICS, as a member of the class of 2023. I'm excited to be taking my first steps 
            into the world of artificial intelligence & machine learning this academic year; I hope to get involved with the field 
            academically, practically, and through research. I'm especially interested (broadly) in neural networks/deep learning, 
            reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and interpretable/explainable machine learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to my research interests, I have professional experience with full-stack web & iOS development. I'm also 
            interested in economics, cognitive science, linguistics, & mathematics as "academic hobbies".

                capable of basic shape creation and manipulation (both graphical and physical) using Swift, and integrated it with 
                Centric's existing infrastructure using mainly Objective-C. I also became more comfortable working in a professional 
                software engineering environment (particularly remotely), and thoroughly enjoyed my time working with the mobile team.

                maintaining a set of several popular UCI-related iOS apps (UCI students may be particularly interested to hear that 
                one such app is ZotFinder, the unofficial official choice for on-campus navigation). As part of this, I work mainly 
                with Swift, Python (using Chalice and AWS Lambda), and various database technologies (AWS DynamoDB & MySQL running on 
                AWS EC2). Through working with the Student Center, I have honed my skills with backend & full-stack iOS development, 
                and also learned to better coexist with a team of like-mindedly passionate developers.

            <p class="description">During summer 2019 (and briefly during the following academic year), I developed a website for 
              Overdecoravite, a local freelance artist. I created a place for them to share their art, as well as to take on 
              commissions and projects from clients, mainly using Python/Django, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. The website also doubled 
              as a simple project management space, allowing the artist to keep track of the projects they've undertaken, and allowing 
              clients to monitor the progress of their projects' completion.

              of this, I help facilitate student learning by holding office hours for several hours per week, and by managing a small 
              group during lecture, where students collaborate to solve participation activities and apply the concepts they learn. 
              Of course, throughout all of this, I'm available to answer student questions and help guide them toward 
              understanding and mastering the material at hand, and also to give them guidance about navigating their studies or the 
              world of computer science in general.

            <p class="description">At HackUCI 2020, two friends and I created <a class="navy" href="https://www.tapestrylearn.com">
              Tapestry</a>, a web-based 
              code visualization tool inspired by the "ASCII memory diagrams" used by one of our professors (which we were 
              fortunate enough to be awarded Best Entrepreneurial Hack for). We aimed to create a tool that could generate these 
              diagrams for arbitrary Python programs, in order to provide an interactive visual learning experience for computer 
              science students. Since the hackathon, we have expanded our initial proof-of-concept to more fully realize this goal, 
              creating a frontend website using TypeScript and Vue that provides a minimalist IDE and diagram display, and a 
              backend API using Python, Django, and SQLite that remotely executes & generates diagrams for Python code snippets.

              <p class="description">For the 2019 FBLA Mobile App Development competition, I worked with 2 other developers to create 
                Trivia Trek, and iOS trivia board game to help users learn about FBLA trivia. We created the game using Swift, 
                SpriteKit, and Firebase, where a user answers a series of questions in order to progress along one of our two "maps" 
                as fast as possible. Particularly, I worked on setting up & managing the cloud infrastructure, rendering and 
                facilitating the gameplay, integrating the Firebase database with the app. For our work on Trivia Trek, my team was 
                fortunate enough to receive recognition at both the state & national levels of competition, placing 2nd at the CA 
                FBLA State Leadership Conference and in the Top 15 at the FBLA National Leadership Conference.
