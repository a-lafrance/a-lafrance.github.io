that I'm currently in the early stages of\n          developing. Two things happened that led to the creation of this project: I (finally) started pursuing my interest in AI/ML in both\n          academics and free time, and I became interested in Rust. Outside of its compile-time safety guarantees & great type system, I gravitated toward\n          Rust for its untapped potential for AI/ML -- it provides C-like performance with runtime-less memory safety, which is unheard of as far as I've seen.\n          While it does come at the cost of a steep learning curve, which I'm admittedly still grappling with, I've been eager to explore what's largely been\n          uncharted (or at least not-as-charted) territory for Rust development. Anyway, on the subject of the actual project, at this point I'm basically\n          playing catchup with a growing laundry list of AI/ML techniques that I'm meaning to implement. I'll also be doing lots of benchmarking and optimization\n          when the baseline implementations are done. To date, I've completed basic probability/statistics functionality and adversarial search is very nearly done.\n          After that I'll be shifting my attention to foundational techniques for classification, regression/optimization, and clustering, at which point I'll branch out\n          into further areas of AI/ML-related interest. Overall, Pensiv has so far been a fascinating combination of software engineering and mathematical/computational\n          challenges, and I'm looking forward to continuing to expand it.",link:"https://github.com/arthurlafrance/Pensiv"},{title:"Tapestry",subtitles:[],description:'The context required to fully understand this project traces back to the experience two of my friends and I had in ICS 33, the third class\n          in the UCI introductory CS series (but the second class we took for... reasons). Anyway, in the early parts of that class Prof. Pattis (the one and only) used\n          "ASCII memory diagrams" for visual demonstrations of the content we were learning. These diagrams were basically ASCII art-like representations of\n          a program\'s state, so the Python variable assignment `x = 1` would have a "box" enclosing x, an "ellipse" enclosing 1, and an "arrow" linking them.\n          We figured that these diagrams were very useful for students who wanted a visual representation of what was happening in their programs, so we created Tapestry\n          at HackUCI 2020, which generates these "memory diagrams" dynamically during the runtime of arbitrary Python code. Granted, we used SVGs rather than ASCII art\n          to render our diagrams, but we tried to infuse Tapestry with as much of Prof. Pattis\'s minimalist flavor as possible. After being fortunate enough to win Best\n          Entrepreneurial Hack at HackUCI, we continued expanding Tapestry until it could, for the most part, generate an appropriate diagram for any arbitrary Python program,\n          appropriately sandboxed of course. To date, Tapestry is probably the most complex piece of software I\'ve built from scratch, so needless to say I\'ve had a great time\n          technically and personally working with my good friends on this project.',link:"https://www.github.com/tapestrylearn"}],learning:[{title:"Rust",subtitles:[],description:"Quite possibly my favorite thing I'm currently learning about; I'll put it simply: Rust is a great programming language.
